        <div class="w3-half">
          <p>Finding an apartment or house in the Bay Area can be stressful, but often times students will be able to find rent under $1000 per month. Keep in mind that the rent increases each year, with larger hikes in areas not protected by rent control.</p>
          <p>Current students often report finding aparments on <a href="https://www.zillow.com/homes/">Zillow</a>, <a href="https://www.apartments.com/">Apartments.com</a>, <a href="https://sfbay.craigslist.org/search/berkeley-ca/apa#search=2~gallery~0">Craigslist</a> or even some Facebook groups.</p>
          <p>Realtors and homeowners will often require you to fill out a rental application. While searching for housing, you should be prepared to have all such information on hand.</p>
          
          <p>These are some things we recommend to bring when house hunting:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Photo identification (driver's license or passport)</li>
            <li>Credit report and/or credit history, if applicable</li>
            <li>Proof of income</li>
            <li>Bank account information</li>
            <li>Personal references</li>
            <li>Previous apartment information, if applicable (names, phone numbers, addresses)</li>
            <li>Employment information (funding offer letter from UC Berkeley/UCSF)</li>
            <li>Vehicle identification number, if applicable</li>

      <div class="row-content" style="padding:20px">
        <p>It is important to register for classes as soon as possible to ensure timely payment of academic fees as well as your first stipend payment. </p>
        <p>Berkeley registration for fall courses typically opens in <b>mid July</b>; UCSF registration typically opens in <b>August</b>. Check your <a href="https://calcentral.berkeley.edu/dashboard">CalCentral</a> and <a href="https://saa.ucsf.edu/studentportal/">UCSF Student Portal</a> pages for enrollment dates. Berkeley classes tend to fill up pretty quick, so make sure to pick your courses ahead of time. UCSF enrollment is conducted by submitting a Study List, and be aware that course times/locations are usually published a bit later.</p>
        <p><b>The most important thing is to register for the required amount of units ASAP</b>; you can easily add and drop courses throughout the beginning of the term. Additionally, don’t worry if your desired Berkeley classes are full. Just register on the waitlist and make sure to show up for the first class sessions, as students are usually able to secure a spot in these classes even if they were full at registration.</p>

        <p>A short guide on how to maintain full-time student status during your first year:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>For Berkeley-based student, enroll in a minimum of 12 units (academic or research) at Berkeley per semester
            <ul>
              <li>Includes 6-7 units of BioE rotation research with your faculty advisor</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            For UCSF-based students, enroll in a minimum of 8 units (academic or research) at UCSF per trimester
            <ul>
              <li>UCSF-based students are automatically affiliated with Berkeley via a 1-unit PSUEDO course directly added by the Berkeley Registrar's Office</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            First year students have three (3) required classes:
            <ol>
              <li>BioE 200 (UCB) AND BioE 281 (UCSF): First Year Seminars, lab overviews and rotation opportunities</li>
              <li>BioE 201 (UCB) OR Grad 214 (UCSF): Responsible Conduct of Research in Bioengineering</li>
              <li>Grad 202 (UCSF): Racism in Science</li>
              <li>BioE 301 (UCB): Teaching Techniques for Bioengineering (Optional, but must be taken during/prior to GSI/TA-ing)</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>Complete a minimum of 12 semester or 18 quarter credits counting towards your major in the first year</li>
        </ul>

        <p>We recommend that you check in with your faculty advisor as soon in the year as possible. They should able to offer guidance on which courses are the best fit for your proposed research area, and can also sign off on your previous coursework for counting towards the Area Requirements. Beast Peer Advisors are also available to help advise on classes that they may know about!</p>
        <p>You can find classes past students have taken to fulfill their major and minor requirements under <a href="#">Course Information [UnderConstruction].</a></p>

      <h5>California Residency & Driver's License</h5>
      <hr>

      <div class="row-content" style="padding:20px">
        <p>The UC schools are large public research universities, and as such, tuition is dependent on the student’s residency status. If you are a US citizen or permanent resident, you are expected to become a resident of California as soon as possible and prior to the Fall of your second year. To do so you must satisfy the “Physical Presence” and “Intent to Remain in California” requirements by the residence determination date, which is the first day of instruction.</p>
        
        <p>Here is a quick list of items that must be completed:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>File a Statement of Legal Residence (SLR) immediately through <a href="https://calcentral.berkeley.edu/dashboard">CalCentral</a> or the <a href="https://saa.ucsf.edu/studentportal/">UCSF Student Portal.</a></li>
          <li>
            Collect documents showing "Physical Presence" and "Intent to Remain in California":
            <ul>
              <li>Evidence of Arrival (Airline tickets, gas receipts)</li>
              <li>California Driver's Lisence</li>
              <li>California Voter Registration</li>
              <li>Bank statements and rental agreements in California</li>
              <li>Tax forms from the prior year (Federal and state)</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>For more detailed information, please see Berkeley's <a href="https://registrar.berkeley.edu/residency/residency-requirements-graduate-students/">Office of the Registrar</a> or UCSF's <a href="https://registrar.ucsf.edu/registration/residency">Office of the Registrar.</a></p>
        
        <p><b>International Students</b>: If you are an international student, you will not be able to become a California Resident for tuition purposes. However you do have to make sure that you have a social security number (SSN). Although the International Office may tell you that you only need an ITIN, just get an SSN to make your own life easier in terms of employment, getting a phone plan, internet plan, or opening a bank account. Contact the department administrator for a letter confirming your employment and start your application as soon as possible. For more detailed information, please see Berkeley’s <a href="https://internationaloffice.berkeley.edu/living/ssnapply">International Office</a> or UCSF's <a href="https://isso.ucsf.edu/social-security-number-ssn">International Students and Scholars Office</a>.</p>

          <p><b>Appointments</b>: The DMV allows for <a href="https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/dmv/dmv/appointments">online scheduling</a> of appointments up to three (3) months in advance. However, depending on the day, walk-in appointments may still be served more quickly than appointments. If you find it challenging to schedule an appointment, it may be worthwhile to take a day to complete your business as a walk-in.</p>
          <p><b>Real ID</b>: Starting Oct. 1, 2020, a regular California driver’s license or ID card won’t be accepted as a valid form of federal identification. Only Real ID will be accepted at federal courthouses, military bases, and airports. You can upgrade your current driver's lisence to a Real ID or obtain a new one through bringing the following items to your appointment:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Proof of Identity (Passport, Birth Certificate)</li>
            <li>Proof of Social Security Number</li>
            <li>Two (2) Proofs of Residency (Lease agreement, paycheck with address, utility bills, bank statement, etc.)</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="row-content" style="padding-left:20px;padding-right:20px;">
        <p><b>Driving Test</b>: If you already hold a valid license from another state, visit a DMV location and take the CA written test and vision test. If you pass these, the driving test is generally waived and a CA license will be granted and your former state’s license will be nullified. If you only hold a valid license from another country, you must also take the driving skills test. A Driving Test requires a specific appointment at the DMV, which are frequently booked up. For the best results, book your appointment early and/or call the DMV to check for open appointments due to last minute cancellations.</p>
        
        <p><b>Locations</b>: Most field offices are open Monday to Saturday, 8AM - 5PM.</p>

      <h5>Research Rotations</h5>
      <hr>
      
      <div class="row-content" style="padding:20px">
        <p>First year students will have the opportunity to do three (3) rotations with <a href="https://bioegrad.berkeley.edu/faculty">core Bioengineering faculty</a>. During your rotations, it's often advised that lab work should be prioritized over coursework, so that you can get the best sense of the lab and whether it would be a good fit.</p> 
        <p>Rotation arrangements and matching occurs throughout the whole year, even starting as early as July and August. Look out for emails from the program managers, which can give you a good timeline for when you should start reaching out to potential PIs. It's important to note that this rotation-matching process is primarily driven by the student, so make sure to be proactive about sending emails and setting up meeting times. Don't be discouraged if some PIs don't respond immediately. It's likely that your email was just lost among the countless emails that professors receive daily. Just send follow-up messages regularly. If possible, try to email professors with the corresponding @berkeley.edu or @ucsf.edu email address; some professors have spam filters set up to weed out anything from outside their home organization.</p>
        <p>In your first meeting with potential mentors, <b>make sure to ask about the lab's funding availability</b>. This can be phrased in questions such as "How many students do you intend on taking this year?" paired with "How many other students are planning to rotate?" Although professors really shouldn't be taking on rotation students they won't be able to fund, it's still important that you make sure your time isn't being wasted.</p>
        <p>To get more advice on how to navigate rotations, the Beast peer advisors, your first year faculty advisor and <a href="https://career.ucsf.edu/gsp/planning-your-time-ucsf">UCSF's Career and Professional Development</a> division are great resources!</p>
